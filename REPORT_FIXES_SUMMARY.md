### How to Use

**RSMI Report:**
The export can accept the following query parameters:
- `entity_name` - Entity name (default: "ATI-RTC I")
- `serial_no` - Serial number (default: current date)
- `fund_cluster` - Fund cluster value (default: blank line)
- `as_of` - Date for the report (default: current date)

**RPC PPE Report:**
The export can accept the following query parameters:
- `ppe_account_group` - PPE Account Group name (default: blank line)
- `as_of_date` - Date for the report (default: "December 31, 2024")
- `location` - Location name (default: "STA. BARBARA, PANGASINAN")

Both exports also support standard filtering parameters used in the controllers.

### Testing Recommendations

1. Test Excel export with sample data
2. Test PDF export with sample data
3. Verify header fields can be filled with custom values via query parameters
4. Check formatting on both landscape and portrait orientations (RPC PPE uses landscape)
5. Verify borders and alignment appear correctly when printed
